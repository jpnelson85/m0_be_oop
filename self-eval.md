# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I felt like I was able to use a lot of the skills I learned this week while also being very overwhelmed.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
The breaks are happening whenever I need them.  They are neccessary to keep me fresh.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to focus on my fundamentals before Mod 1 starts.
